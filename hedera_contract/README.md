# Hedera Staking Contract

A Hedera-based staking contract built using the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) and Solidity.

## 🧩 Overview
This project implements a staking contract on the Hedera Hashgraph network. It allows users to stake HBAR or supported tokens, earn rewards, and manage their staking positions directly on-chain.

The contract leverages Hedera’s EVM-compatible Smart Contract Service, ensuring fast, secure, and low-cost staking operations.

## ⚙️ Features
- Stake and unstake tokens
- View total staked balance and user rewards
- Automated reward distribution logic
- Transparent on-chain recordkeeping
