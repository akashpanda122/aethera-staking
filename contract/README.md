# Hedera Staking Contract

A Hedera-based staking contract built using the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) and Solidity.

## 🧩 Overview

This project implements a staking contract on the Hedera Hashgraph network.
It allows users to stake HBAR or supported tokens, earn rewards, and manage their staking positions directly on-chain.

The contract leverages Hedera’s EVM-compatible Smart Contract Service, ensuring fast, secure, and low-cost staking operations.

## ⚙️ Features

- Stake and unstake tokens
- View total staked balance and user rewards
- Automated reward distribution logic
- Transparent on-chain recordkeeping

## 🚀 Deployment

The contract is deployed on Hedera Testnet for development and testing.
